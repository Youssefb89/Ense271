Ense 271 lab 2

In this lab, we learnt about site maps  and asset inventories as tools for documenting the high-level structure and content of a web application, which are key components of Information Architecture. We explored how site maps help organize pages hierarchically, plan user navigation, and align with business goals, while asset inventories track all necessary content (text, images, videos, etc.) to ensure completeness. We also practiced card sorting to logically group content and discussed the differences between visual sitemaps (for humans) and XML sitemaps (for search engines). Additionally, we were introduced to Figma, a design tool used to create UI mockups and diagrams, and applied it to build a sitemap. Finally, we performed a content audit on an existing website, creating both a sitemap and an asset inventory, while following best practices like consistent file naming conventions and using spreadsheets to manage assets collaboratively.


After exploring various websites for this lab, I chose Green Valley Landscape Maintenance (https://www.greenvalleylandscaping.com/ ) because it is small (3â€“5 pages) and aligns with the assignment criteria. Its simple structure made it ideal for practicing sitemap creation and conducting an asset inventory , while its focus on landscaping services provided clear content categories.

The website includes essential pages like Home , Services , About Us , and Contact , typical of small business sites. This allowed me to practice information architecture by organizing content hierarchically. I also identified assets such as hero banner images, service icons, and text descriptions, which I documented in the asset inventory to ensure completeness.

This site enabled me to apply techniques like card sorting indirectly by logically grouping related content, such as services under specific headings. This reinforced the importance of structuring content to meet user expectations. Additionally, its straightforward navigation helped me create a visual sitemap , visualizing how users might move through the site to achieve goals like learning about services or contacting the company.

I conducted a content audit , listing all assets, including text, images, and icons, and named files using the Linux standard format for consistency. This process highlighted the value of planning content before redesigning a website and reinforced user-centered design principles .

Using Figma , I created a sitemap and organized findings, gaining hands-on experience with tools for diagramming and planning. Finally, I included a readme.txt file explaining my thought process, decisions (e.g., prioritizing pages in the sitemap), and how these decisions are reflected in the deliverables. This exercise emphasized the importance of tracking assets collaboratively and planning content to meet both user needs and business goals.
