Ense 271 lab 1


In this lab, we learned about GitHub as a tool for showcasing work in the software industry, including how to set up and use Git for version control, create repositories, and maintain a professional portfolio. We explored best practices for GitHub, such as writing clear commit messages, avoiding junk files, and using branches effectively. Additionally, we were introduced to User Story Mapping, a UX exercise to prioritize features for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and practiced it using StoriesOnBoard. Finally, we applied these concepts by creating a User Story Map for a grocery delivery app and setting up a private GitHub repository to document our progress throughout the semester.

User Story Mapping 
I began by identifying the main "goals" or "epics" that the grocery delivery app should achieve and what.I also used the 8 steps given to describe user-story mapping:
Collect Features
Add Details
Place Cards in Sequential Order
Group by Frequency
Note Logical Breaks in Workflow
Mark the First System Span
Fill in Build Estimates
Slice and Serve




After brainstorming, I settled on the following key epics: Account Management , Browsing Products , Selecting Groceries , Buy Groceries , and Delivery and Tracking .





Next, I broke these epics down into smaller details, focusing on the specific steps and tasks required to accomplish each goal. This process resulted in 5 epics , 8 walking skeleton steps , and a total of 25 tasks .

Once I had all my ideas laid out, I organized the walking skeleton steps into their appropriate positions within the user story map. I then ranked the tasks based on their importance and assigned them to specific releases, ensuring that the most critical features were prioritized for earlier releases.

As an additional feature, I customized the color of the epics, changing them to pink to make them visually distinct and easier to identify.
