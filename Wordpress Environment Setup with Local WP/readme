In this lab, we learnt how to set up and use **Local WP** to create a local WordPress development environment for prototyping and testing websites. We explored the basics of WordPress, including its use of themes, plugins, and blocks to design and customize web pages. We also practiced creating static pages, blog posts, and menus, and learned how to use the block editor to add and arrange content. Additionally, we were introduced to **Starter Templates**, which allow us to quickly import pre-designed templates for faster development. 

As part of the lab, we also explored **personas**, a UX exercise where we create fictional yet realistic descriptions of target users to guide design decisions. For the assignment, we created a persona for someone buying concert tickets and used it to design a personal website or blog in WordPress. This involved creating a home page, three static pages, and a blog with three posts, while experimenting with different blocks and navigation structures. Finally, we documented our work with screenshots to showcase the functionality of the site. 

Overall, this lab emphasized the importance of understanding user needs through personas and provided hands-on experience in building and customizing WordPress sites.
