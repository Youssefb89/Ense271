Ense 271 Lab 3

In this lab, we learnt about site maps and asset inventories as tools for planning and organizing web applications, which are key components of Information Architecture . We explored how site maps help structure content hierarchically, plan user navigation, and align with business goals, while asset inventories track all necessary content (text, images, videos, etc.) to ensure completeness. We also practiced card sorting to logically group content and discussed the differences between visual sitemaps (for humans) and XML sitemaps (for search engines).

Additionally, we were introduced to Figma , a design tool used to create UI mockups and diagrams, and applied it to build a sitemap . Finally, we performed a content audit on an existing website, creating both a sitemap and an asset inventory while following best practices like consistent file naming conventions and using spreadsheets to manage assets collaboratively.

After exploring various designs on Dribbble, I chose the **e-Commerce Platform WIP** for this lab. It aligns with the assignment criteria and reflects my personal interest in e-commerce, making it both relevant and inspiring. The design features a clean, modern aesthetic with at least 10 unique components, such as buttons, icons, and text elements, providing an excellent opportunity to practice Figma tools like Boolean operations, masking, and Auto Layout.

I was particularly drawn to its intuitive layout and visually appealing elements, such as gradients and interactive components, which strike a balance between simplicity and complexity. This makes it challenging yet manageable while allowing me to experiment with advanced techniques. By recreating this design, I aim to deepen my understanding of high-fidelity wireframing and improve my Figma skills. 

In summary, I selected this design because it fits the assignment requirements, aligns with my interests, and offers a meaningful learning experience.
